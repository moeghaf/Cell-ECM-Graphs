# Cell-ECM-Graphs

As an extention of traditional cell graphs, we present a novel framework called cell-ECM graphs, which incorporates both cellular and ECM components into a single graph, allowing for the analysis of cell-cell, ECM-ECM, and cell-ECM interactions.

## Requirments
Python 3.12.3

`git` for cloning the repository

## Usage Examples
### Python Notebook: 
For a simple tutorial using a single ROI in Python, refer to the [Lung_CEG notebook](tutorial/Lung_single_ROI.ipynb).

### Command Line:  
Can be used to process multiple ROIs easily:

#### Step 1: Clone Cell-ECM-Graphs
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moeghaf/Cell-ECM-Graphs.git
```

#### Step 2: Navigate to Cell-ECM-Graphs
cd Cell-ECM-Graphs

#### Step 3: Create new environment and activate 
conda create --name cellECMgraphs python=3.11.9

conda activate cellECMgraphs 

#### Step 4: Install requirements 
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Step 5:
